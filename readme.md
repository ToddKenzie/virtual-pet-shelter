# Virtual Pet Shelter

**WeCanCodeIT Module 3 Project**

## Objective

User will be in control of a pet shelter with multiple pets.  It is the user's responsibility to take of all of the pets in the shelter.  Pets should also be able to be adopted through the shelter, and more pets can come in.

### How This Project May Differ From Other Students

Work in progress - yet to be determined
**Ideas to consider**
* Have the user keep the cages clean as well
* Any other additional attributes that the pet should have?
* List of descriptions to use as a default
* Multiple Pet Types
	* Different description lists, attributes for each
* Would some pets be auto-adopted based on their well-being?
* Would some pets show up at random at the shelter, looking for a home?
* Would the user be terminated for taking poor care of the shelter?
